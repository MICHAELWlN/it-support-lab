# IT Helpdesk VM Lab Setup

## Overview
This lab simulates setting up a Windows Server 2019 VM for basic IT support functions including configuring networking and adding server roles.

- Assigned static IP: `10.0.0.5`
- Subnet: `255.0.0.0`
- Gateway: `10.0.0.1`

## 4. Add Core Server Roles

**Screenshot: Server Roles Selected**  
![Server Roles](./screenshots/01a-vm-server-manager-role-selection.png)(./screenshots/01b-vm-server-manager-role-selection.png)

- Installed **DHCP Server** to handle dynamic IP assignment for future client VM(s).
- Installed **DNS Server** to enable domain name resolution for internal network services.
- Installed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** to configure domain controller functionality and support user authentication.
- Installed **File and Storage Services** to support shared folders and simulate mapped drive access.
- Installed **Print and Document Services** with Print Server role to simulate network printer sharing and print-related support tickets.
- Installed **Web Server (IIS)** to host internal websites for simulating internal apps, and troubleshooting “site unavailable” errors.

> Resolved validation warning by setting a static IP address prior to role installation.

## 5. Summary

- VM is now fully initialized with core infrastructure roles.
- These services will support help desk simulations like:
  - Domain join issues
  - DNS lookup failures
  - Printer access problems
  - Group policy misconfigurations
  - Internal web service outages
