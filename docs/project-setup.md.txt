# IT Helpdesk VM Lab Setup

## Overview
This lab simulates setting up a Windows Server 2019 VM for basic IT support functions including configuring networking and adding server roles.

---

## 1. VM Initialization

- Booted up the VM using Azure.
- Launched Server Manager and verified default configuration.

---

## 2. Network Configuration

- Opened Command Prompt to check current IP settings.

## 3. Set Static IP Address

- Assigned static IP: `10.0.0.5`
- Subnet: `255.0.0.0`
- Gateway: `10.0.0.1`

## 4. Add Core Server Roles

**Screenshot: Server Roles Selected**  
![Server Roles](./screenshots/01a-vm-server-manager-role-selection.png)(./screenshots/01b-vm-server-manager-role-selection.png)

- Installed **DHCP Server** to handle dynamic IP assignment for future client VM(s).
- Installed **DNS Server** to enable domain name resolution for internal network services.
- Installed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** to configure domain controller functionality and support user authentication.
- Installed **File and Storage Services** to support shared folders and simulate mapped drive access.
- Installed **Print and Document Services** with Print Server role to simulate network printer sharing and print-related support tickets.
- Installed **Web Server (IIS)** to host internal websites for simulating internal apps, and troubleshooting “site unavailable” errors.

> Resolved validation warning by setting a static IP address prior to role installation.

## 6. Promote Server to Domain Controller
Screenshot: Server promoted to domain controller (./screenshot/vm-server-promotion.png)

- After installing AD DS, a post-deployment task appeared in Server Manager:
Promote this server to a domain controller

- Selected Add a new forest

- Root domain name: mydomain.local

- Chose Windows Server 2016 for both:

- Forest functional level

- Domain functional level

- Enabled:

- DNS Server

- Global Catalog (GC)

- Set Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password: P@ssw0rd123!

- Warning appeared:
- "A delegation for this DNS server cannot be created..."

- Expected in standalone or lab setups — safe to ignore.

- Continued with the installation

- Restarted VM when prompted

## 7. Domain Controller Verification
- Screenshot: Server Manager - AD DS Active (./screenshot/vm-domain-creation.png)

- Screenshot: Tools Menu - Domain Tools Available (./screenshot/vm-john-doe-creation.png)

- Logged in as:

- makefile
- Copy
- Edit
- Username: MYDOMAIN\Administrator
- Password: P@ssw0rd123!
- Verified successful promotion:

- AD DS active in Server Manager

- Accessed tools:

- Active Directory Users and Computers

- DNS

- Group Policy Management

## 8. Create Organizational Unit and Test User
Screenshot: OU and test user created (./screenshot/vm-ou-creation.png)

- In Active Directory Users and Computers:

- Created Organizational Unit (OU): LabUsers

- Created test user:

- Username: john.doe
- Email: test.user@mydomain.local
- Password: Jd@123456!
## 9. Grant RDP Access to Domain User
- Screenshot: John Doe added to Remote Desktop Users

- Added john.doe to Remote Desktop Users group

- This grants permission to log in via RDP

## 10. Confirm RDP Login as Domain User
- Screenshot: RDP Login as John Doe (./screenshot/vm-rdp-access-for-john-doe.png)
- Screenshot: Successful login with first mock user (./screenshot/vm-successful-log-in-john-doe.png)

- Successfully logged in using:

Username: john.doe@mydomain.local
Password: Jd@123456!
Verified domain login and RDP access — domain controller setup complete

## 11. Changed the Ipv4 settings of the client virtual machine I made to match the private IP address of my domain controller
- Ran ipconfig /flushdns, and ipconfig /registerdns to set the new dns on the client machine
- Tested domain connectivity with ping
- Remember to run command prompt as admin
- Found out domain name by running Win R on DC vm and typing sysdm.cpl and looking under the computer name tab, mydomain.local
