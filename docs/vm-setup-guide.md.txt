# VM Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps taken to configure a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine in Microsoft Azure for the IT Support Lab project.

## Step 1: VM Basics Configuration

The following options were selected when creating the virtual machine:

- **Image**: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter â€“ x64 Gen2 (Free Tier Eligible)
- **Size**: Standard_B1s â€“ 1 vCPU, 1 GiB memory (within free trial credits)
- **Region**: East US
- **Availability Zone**: Zone 1
- **Username**: adminuser
- **Authentication**: Password
- **Inbound Port Rule**: RDP (3389) enabled for remote access

## Disk Configuration

In this step, I configured the virtual machine's OS disk settings.

- OS Disk Size: Image default (127 GiB)
- Disk Type: Premium SSD (LRS)
- Encryption: Platform-managed key
- Delete with VM: Enabled to conserve resources
- No additional data disks were added

## VM Networking Configuration

This section outlines the virtual network interface setup for the Windows Server 2019 VM in Azure. Screenshots are included to show detailed configuration settings.

### Network Interface Settings

- **Virtual Network**: (new) windows-lab-vm-vnet
- **Subnet**: (new) default (10.0.0.0/24)
- **Public IP**: (new) windows-lab-vm-ip
- **NIC Network Security Group**: Basic
- **Public Inbound Ports**: Allow selected ports
- **Inbound Port Rules**: RDP (3389) â€” enables remote desktop access

> ðŸ”’ **Note**: Allowing all IP addresses is suitable for temporary lab/testing purposes only. For production environments, IP restrictions should be applied.

### Load Balancing

- **Load Balancing**: None

## VM Management Configuration

This section covers the settings configured under the **Management** tab during the creation of the Windows Server 2019 VM.

### Management Settings

* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Enabled basic plan for free  
* **System Assigned Managed Identity**: Not enabled  
* **Microsoft Entra ID**: Not enabled  
* **Auto-shutdown**: Not enabled  
* **Backup**: Not enabled  
* **Guest OS Updates**: Not enabled  
* **Patch Orchestration Options**: Automatic by OS (Windows Automatic Updates)

> **Note**: Auto-shutdown was left disabled because I will manually shut down the VM after each use based on my work schedule. This ensures flexibility while avoiding unnecessary runtime costs.

## VM Monitoring Configuration

This section explains how monitoring was disabled to stay within the Azure free tier.

### Monitoring Settings

* **Enable Recommended Alert Rules**: Not enabled  
* **Boot Diagnostics**: Disabled  
* **OS Guest Diagnostics**: Not enabled  
* **Application Health Monitoring**: Not enabled

> **Note**: Monitoring was disabled to reduce storage and telemetry usage, keeping the setup free during the Azure trial period.

VM Advanced Configuration
This section outlines additional options under the Advanced tab for the Windows Server 2019 VM. These were configured to avoid any charges outside the Azure free tier.

Advanced Settings
Extensions: None selected

VM Applications: None selected

Custom Data: Not provided

User Data: Not enabled

NVMe Performance: Not enabled

Host Group: No host groups found

Capacity Reservation Group: None

Proximity Placement Group: None

Note: All advanced settings were left at their default values to ensure compatibility with the free services included in the Azure trial. These options are intended for more complex or performance-intensive scenarios and are not needed for this lab setup.

VM Tags Configuration
This section describes the Tags settings used during the virtual machine setup. Tags are optional and used primarily for organizing resources in production environments.

Tag Settings
Tags Used: None

Resource Scope: Not specified (default 14 resources)

Note: Tags were not applied since this is a single VM lab setup for educational purposes and does not require billing or resource grouping management.

VM Final Review and Configuration Summary
This section summarizes the full VM configuration as reviewed before deployment. Screenshots are included to verify each section and confirm that the build meets project and cost-efficiency goals.

Summary Settings
Subscription: Azure subscription 1
Resource Group: (new) it-lab-rg
VM Name: windows-lab-vm
Region: East US
Image: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - Gen2
Size: Standard B1s (1 vCPU, 1 GiB memory)
OS Disk Type: Premium SSD LRS
Public Inbound Ports: RDP (3389)
Monitoring & Management: All disabled except Microsoft Defender (Basic/Free)
Networking: Custom VNet/Subnet, Public IP enabled, Accelerated Networking: Off
Advanced Settings: All left at defaults to reduce complexity and cost
